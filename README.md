# SkiPassAnalysis
As a skier in the state of Maine and Vermont, I was interested in exploring the following question: what determines a season pass cost for a given mountain based on the physical features of the resort and mountain? In this project I explored this question using a few forms of regression analysis. 

Methods Used: Multiple Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, Random Forest
